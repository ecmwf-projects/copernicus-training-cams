# Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Data Tutorials

***Discover how to access and handle atmospheric composition data!***

This website contains Jupyter notebook based tutorials that demonstrate how to access and process the wide variety of data provided by the [Atmosphere Data Store (CDS)](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/) of the [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/). Each tutorial provides interactive examples of common workflows to derive information about atmospheric composition. They include code in Python and content in Markdown to provide clear, engaging and practical instructions on data handling which can be run in various cloud environments without any need for installation. You are invited to experiment with these tutorials and tailor them to your needs to extract results meaningful to you! The tutorials make use of data freely available on the ADS and accessed using an Application Programming Interface (API).
